TODOs:
Label sliced images - Daniel (DONE)
Split data into training and testing - Roarke (DONE)
Make our own CNN - Roarke (MOSTLY DONE)
Try a pre-trained DNN - Tim
IOU - Josh (Loss measures included in current model)
--NEW--
Use visualize.py for displaying boxes/masks
Try training in with different steps/epochs/head v full
Need to clean and organise all code

Notes:
When predicting on a full size image, the image may need to be broken down 
into same dimensions as training data and stitched back together
Current accuracy roughly 65%
