TODOs:
Label sliced images - Daniel (DONE)
Split data into training and testing - Roarke (DONE)
Make our own CNN - Roarke (DONE)
Try a pre-trained DNN - Tim (Roarke DONE)
IOU - Josh (Roarke - DONE [Loss measures included in current model])
Use visualize.py for displaying boxes/masks (DONE)
Try training in with different steps/epochs/head v full (DONE)
--NEW--
Need to clean and organise all code

Notes:
When predicting on a full size image, the image may need to be broken down 
into same dimensions as training data and stitched back together
Current accuracy roughly 80%
